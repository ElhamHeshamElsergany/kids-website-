                        Define behaviors
                        The first step in a good behavior management plan is to identify target behaviors. These
                        behaviors should be specific (so everyone is clear on what is expected), observable, and
                        measurable (so everyone can agree whether or not the behavior happened).

                        An example of poorly defined behavior is “acting up,” or “being good.” A well-defined behavior
                        would be running around the room (bad) or starting homework on time (good).

                        Antecedents, the good and the bad
                        Antecedents come in many forms. Some prop up bad behavior, others are helpful tools that help
                        parents manage potentially problematic behaviors before they begin and bolster good behavior

                        Positive mental health in children includes achieving appropriate developmental, emotional, and
                        social milestones and using coping skills to function successfully at home, school, and in the
                        community. Unfortunately, approximately 13% to 20% of children in the United States have a
                        mental health problem, and many of these problems have a direct impact on their behavior (Perou
                        et al., 2013). It is estimated that 25% of children will have a mental health problem sometime
                        during their childhood or adolescence. Parents report that the most common behavioral diagnoses
                        among children ages 3 to 17 years include attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (6.8%),
                        conduct problems (3.5%), anxiety (3.0%), depression (2.1%), and autism spectrum disorders
                        (1.1%). Data from 1994-2011 indicate that the prevalence of these conditions is increasing

                        Moving to a new city or town can be overwhelming for any child. Amid the chaos of packing, kids
                        are forced to say goodbye to friends, teachers, and the familiar comfort of their community.

                        After the move, kids must acclimate to a new school, where they might find themselves lagging
                        behind the rest of their classmates. Many children worry about being “the new kid,” and some
                        find it hard to make new friends.

                        For the children of military families, the challenges of a relocation—or Permanent Change of
                        Station—are particularly acute. For one thing, military families relocate more frequently than
                        civilian families (every two to three years, on average) and they tend to move greater
                        distances. When military families move from bases to civilian neighborhoods, children often feel
                        isolated from their peers, who can’t identify with the military lifestyle. <button

                        This study attempted to establish whether an optimal age could be identified at which children
                        were ready to learn the front crawl swimming stroke. The variables examined were: the number of
                        lessons, the age of commencing lessons and the time duration for learning to swim 10m front
                        crawl (Level 3). Longitudinal records of 326 children, aged between 2 and 8 years, were analysed
                        using General Linear Model two-way (Age x Sex) analysis of variance procedures. The main effect
                        for age was significant (p 0.001) for all three variables. Post hoc analysis revealed that the
                        children who started at 5 years of age received significantly fewer number of lessons and
                        took shorter duration compared to those who commenced learning to swim at an earlier age.
                        Whether pupils started lessons at 2, 3 or 4 years of age, they achieved Level 3 at
                        approximately the same mean age of 5 1/2 years. The optimal readiness period was identified
                        in this study to be between 5 and 6 years of age. There was little evidence of gender
                        differences for all three variables. <button class="btn btn-info"> <a class="styletext text-white"
